1. **User Input**:  
   - Users type their questions in the Streamlit interface (e.g., "What is the best economy strategy for Mirage?").  
2. **Backend Processing**:  
   - The query is sent to the Flask backend, which processes it and retrieves the relevant information.  
3. **Response Generation**:  
   - The backend sends the response back to the Streamlit frontend, which displays it to the user.
